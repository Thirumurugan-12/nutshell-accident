A novel system for predicting traffic accidents using 3D vehicle tracking. The system uses 3D models to accurately track vehicles and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn unique activity patterns based on vehicle trajectories and velocities. 

<br>

A probability model is then developed to predict the likelihood of traffic accidents. This data-driven approach can improve safety by identifying high-risk areas and driver behaviour, optimizing traffic flow, and contributing to a safer and more efficient transportation system.
